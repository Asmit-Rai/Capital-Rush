# Web-Blogging

## 🚀 Objective
Design and develop a full-stack web application using **React, Firebase, and Node.js** that allows users to sign up, log in, and create, edit, and delete posts. The application is **responsive, secure, and optimized for performance**.

## 📌 Features
### 🔐 User Authentication (Firebase Authentication)
- Sign-up and login functionality using **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password authentication).
- Error handling for failed authentication attempts.
- Protected authenticated routes.

### 🎨 Frontend (React, Tailwind CSS)
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of posts created by users.
- **Sign-up/Login Page**: Allows user authentication.
- **Dashboard**: Enables logged-in users to create, edit, and delete their posts.
- Form validation and user-friendly error messages.
- Fully responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS**.

### 🖥 Backend (Node.js, Express, Firebase Firestore)
- **Express server** to handle API requests.
- **CRUD operations for posts**:
  - Create: Authenticated users can create posts (title, description, and timestamp stored in Firestore).
  - Read: Fetch and display posts on the Home page.
  - Update: Users can edit their own posts.
  - Delete: Users can delete their own posts.
- Authentication and authorization to ensure users modify only their own posts.

### 🔥 Firebase Firestore (Database)
- User data and posts stored securely in Firestore.
- Optimized queries for fetching only necessary data.

### 🌎 Deployment & Version Control
- **Frontend hosted on Vercel**.
- **Backend deployed on Vercel**.
- **GitHub repository for version control**.
